   Our ER diagram shows the data relationship between our business of highway roasted peanut stand. All the outer tables are data sets that enter into the main data set on the Peanut Stand itself to give us all the information relevant to it. The first box and entity we have leading into the Stand table, is Location. This tells us where on the highway the stand is located, the visibility of the stand, whether itâ€™s obscured by shrubs or not, and the speed of the highway, allowing us to see how easy it is for cars and trucks to stop for the peanuts. Next up, is the data table on hot plates, important pieces of equipment that keep the peanuts warm for our customers. This data set will tell us their cost, size, and how long they will last before needing replaced. Our next data set is on the fryers, again used to fry peanuts. The will, like the previous table, tell us the cost of the fryers, their size, and life span, so we know when to buy new fryers for the stand. The next data table is set on the Peanuts themselves. In this data set we learn, the name, or what kinds of peanuts we are selling, the cost of peanuts, and their sales price, for a profit. The next data set is the customer data set. This one will tell us what the gender of the customer is, the type of vehicle they drive, if they are with their family, and their age. This will allow us to see what demographics we are catering to. The last data set is the table on employees, which will tell us each employees name, phone number, and job title. All these tables with their own unique entity each relating in some way to the center of our diagram the Peanut Stand.
